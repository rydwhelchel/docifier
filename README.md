# docifier
Putting this project on hold, going to create [docify](https://github.com/rydwhelchel/docify) (very creative and new name) which just outputs the target lines as those are the more annoying ones to write and limiting scope makes it easier to write and more useful. Makes more since to automate making one line and then just copy it over
`docifier` is a small CLI project to assist with creating documentation. I'm using it to help with learning Rust and it won't have much use outside of my specific need for it.
